# Understanding SSG

Static Site Generation (SSG) is the method of generating HTML for each page in advance, instead of doing it on demand.

## How it works

Next.js pre-renders pages at build time. The HTML is then reused on each request.

## Advantages

- **Performance**: CDN caching.
- **SEO**: Search engines love static HTML.
