# Why Use Docker?

Docker allows you to package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development.

## Benefits

1.  **Consistency**: Works on my machine = works on production.
2.  **Isolation**: No conflicting dependencies.
3.  **Portability**: Run anywhere.

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-app
```
