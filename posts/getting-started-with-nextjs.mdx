# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js gives you the best developer experience with all the features you need for production: hybrid static & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more.

## Why Next.js?

- **Zero Config**: Automatic compilation and bundling.
- **Hybrid**: SSG and SSR supported.
- **Fast Refresh**: Fast, reliable live-editing experience.

```javascript
// Example of a page
export default function Home() {
  return <h1>Hello Next.js</h1>
}
```
